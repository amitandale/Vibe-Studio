# Supabase Lane Setup Guide

This document walks you through provisioning and maintaining the self-hosted Supabase stacks that power the `main`, `work`, and `codex` lanes.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Install these utilities on the runner before provisioning Supabase services:

- Docker Engine 24+
- Docker Compose (plugin)
- Supabase CLI 2.53+ (`supabase`)
- PostgreSQL client tools (`psql`, `pg_isready`)
- `jq`
- `python3`
- `curl`
- `openssl`

The Supabase CLI drives all lane database and Edge automation. The lane
helpers automatically download a pinned release (default `2.53.6`) into
`$SUPABASE_STATE_DIR/bin` the first time they run on a host where `supabase`
is missing. You can override the version by exporting
`SUPABASE_CLI_VERSION=<tag>` before invoking any Supabase script or by
pre-installing the CLI somewhere on `PATH`.

Verify availability (after the bootstrap runs once or if you install it
system-wide):

```bash
which docker docker compose supabase psql jq python3 curl openssl
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Each Git branch class maps to its own long-lived Supabase lane. Every lane runs its own Compose project containing PostgreSQL, GoTrue auth, PostgREST, Realtime, Storage API, Imgproxy, Edge runtime, and Kong. Volumes, ports, and API keys are isolated so deployments do not interfere with each other.

## üî¢ Port Allocation

| Lane  | PGHOST_PORT / PGPORT | KONG_HTTP_PORT | EDGE_PORT |
|-------|:--------------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
| main  |         5433         |      8101      |    9901   |
| work  |         5434         |      8102      |    9902   |
| codex |         5435         |      8103      |    9903   |

Each container continues to listen on port `5432`; the lane env mirrors the published host binding in both `PGHOST_PORT` and
`PGPORT` so local tooling consistently targets the exposed service.

Volumes follow the pattern `supa-<lane>-db` and Compose project names default to `supa-<lane>`.

## üîê Credential Source of Truth

`ops/supabase/lanes/credentials.env` is still the canonical location for lane database
passwords, but the Supabase CLI now reads every credential directly from the hydrated
lane env. Provisioning records the lane connection string as `SUPABASE_DB_URL` (including
`?sslmode=disable` for local runners) and the automation feeds it straight into
`supabase db` and `supabase functions` commands. Local Postgres containers ship with
TLS disabled, so the helper explicitly opts out of SSL to prevent the Supabase CLI from
attempting a TLS handshake that will be refused.

Because the CLI wrapper exports lane credentials on demand, helpers no longer rewrite
`PGPASSWORD` into temporary files. You can operate in passwordless or password-backed
modes by editing `ops/supabase/lanes/<lane>.env` directly or rotating the entries in
`credentials.env` and regenerating the lane env file.

## üöÄ Initial Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository onto the runner** (or reuse the deployment checkout).
2. **Sync the pinned Supabase docker directory** so helpers can hydrate defaults straight from upstream and Compose can access every referenced asset. Ensure `ops/supabase/SUPABASE_DOCKER_REF` points to a real Supabase tag or commit (for example `1.25.04`) before running the helper:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/supabase/sync_docker_assets.sh
   ```
   The reference tag or commit is stored in `ops/supabase/SUPABASE_DOCKER_REF`. When you need to upgrade Supabase, update that file to the desired tag, rerun the sync script, review the resulting diff (including `ops/supabase/lanes/latest-docker`), and commit the changes. The automation refuses to run if the directory or either file is missing, keeping the single source of truth anchored to the pinned Supabase release.
   During deploys the workflow automatically refreshes the referenced images with `docker compose --project-directory ops/supabase/lanes/latest-docker --env-file ops/supabase/lanes/<lane>.env -f ops/supabase/lanes/latest-docker-compose.yml pull` before services start, so keeping the synced directory up to date with the pinned release is enough to track upstream updates.
3. **Provision lane environment files** (CI will also auto-provision on first run once the credentials are present):
   - Review or edit `ops/supabase/lanes/credentials.env`. Each lane entry defines the Postgres password plus the fallback Supabase admin role/password that the workflow can reuse. You can leave the superuser password blank when the database trusts passwordless connections; the provisioning helper will still emit a usable `SUPABASE_DB_URL` for the CLI.
   - Generate the per-lane env files (non-secret settings) straight from those committed credentials:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/supabase/provision_lane_env.sh main --pg-super-role supabase_admin
     ./scripts/supabase/provision_lane_env.sh work --pg-super-role supabase_admin
     ./scripts/supabase/provision_lane_env.sh codex --pg-super-role supabase_admin
     ```
     Supabase service versions track the upstream compose file you downloaded. To pin a particular release, fetch the compose and `.env` from the desired Supabase tag before running the helper.
   - To rotate passwords, edit `credentials.env` (or pass explicit `--pg-password/--pg-super-password` flags) and rerun the helper. The next deploy automatically injects the updated credentials into the database and Compose runtime.
    - Restored clusters that keep a legacy superuser should update `credentials.env` (or pass overrides) with that account so the deploy workflow can recreate the primary `PGUSER`/`SUPABASE_SUPER_ROLE` when it is missing:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/supabase/provision_lane_env.sh codex \
       --pg-super-role supabase_admin \
       --pg-super-password '<existing-supabase-admin-password>'
     ```

### Restore existing superusers

When you reuse a Supabase volume that was initialized elsewhere, populate the fallback credentials with the existing
superuser so the deploy workflow reconnects with that account and realigns container roles automatically. The helper
validates the configured `PGUSER` superuser on every run and reapplies its password before migrations execute:

```bash
./scripts/supabase/provision_lane_env.sh <lane> \
  --pg-super-role <existing_superuser> \
  --pg-super-password '<existing_superuser_password>'
```

If you do not know the values, connect directly on the host and inspect available roles (for example, with
`docker exec -it supa-<lane>-db-1 psql -U <known_superuser> -d postgres -c "\\du"`). Once the env file contains valid
credentials, rerun the deploy workflow. The lane helper shells into the database container and recreates or resets the
stored roles using those credentials before migrations run, so the lane is healed automatically on the next deploy.

4. **Replace temporary JWT keys** (recommended for production):
   - Generate with Supabase CLI: `supabase secrets set --from-env lane.env`
   - Or use the Supabase dashboard tools to mint signed keys.
   - Update the generated `.env` file values.
5. **Start services for each lane**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/supabase/lane.sh main start
   ./scripts/supabase/lane.sh work start
   ./scripts/supabase/lane.sh codex start
   ```
6. **Verify health**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/supabase/lane.sh main health
   ./ops/bin/healthwait.sh http://127.0.0.1:8101 60
   curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:9901/
   ```
7. **Run migrations manually (optional)** to confirm connectivity:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/supabase/migrate.sh main
   ```

## üîê Security Best Practices

- Never commit the generated `ops/supabase/lanes/*.env` files (they are gitignored) and keep the repository checkout secured with `700/600` permissions on any file that stores secrets.
- Generated secrets are placeholders‚Äîreplace them with signed keys managed by your secret rotation tooling.
- Keep file permissions strict (`600`) and restrict runner access.
- Rotate `PGPASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ANON_KEY`, and `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` regularly.
- Store canonical secrets in your runner‚Äôs secret store (e.g., Ansible vault, 1Password CLI) and re-run the provisioning script with `--pg-password` when rotating. `ops/supabase/lanes/credentials.env` is the sole source of truth for database credentials‚Äîkeep it encrypted at rest and update it before redeploying.
- Keep the Supabase admin password distinct from every lane password; the automation will not reset it for you.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Missing env file**: Run `./scripts/supabase/provision_lane_env.sh <lane>` on the runner. This regenerates `ops/supabase/lanes/<lane>.env` from the checked-in credentials.
- **Weak password warning**: Update the password in `ops/supabase/lanes/credentials.env`, rerun the provisioning script, and redeploy.
- **Compose failures**: Confirm Docker can pull the images referenced in `ops/supabase/lanes/latest-docker/docker-compose.yml`. If an upstream tag disappears, fetch a tagged release of the Supabase repository and rerun the provisioning helper so configuration files stay in sync.
- **`role "<pg-user>" does not exist` during deploy**: Supply the superuser credentials with `--pg-super-role/--pg-super-password` (or update `credentials.env`) and rerun the provisioning script so the workflow can recreate the missing lane role automatically. The helper expects the stored secrets to match the database before re-running the deploy.
- **Kong not healthy**: Review logs via `docker compose --project-directory ops/supabase/lanes/latest-docker -f ops/supabase/lanes/latest-docker/docker-compose.yml logs kong` with the lane env sourced.
- **Migrations stuck**: Check for lingering advisory locks with `SELECT pg_advisory_unlock_all();` in `psql`.
- **`tls error (server refused TLS connection)` or `could not open file "global/pg_filenode.map": Permission denied` during `supabase db push`**: Ensure the lane connection string ends with `?sslmode=disable` and that the Postgres container allows plaintext connections. If the error persists, the Supabase database volume permissions or superuser password have likely drifted. Run the following from the lane checkout:

  ```bash
  docker compose --profile db-only exec db chown -R postgres:postgres /var/lib/postgresql/data
  docker compose --profile db-only restart db
  docker compose --profile db-only exec db psql -U postgres -d "${PGDATABASE:-postgres}" -c "ALTER USER supabase_admin WITH PASSWORD '<password-from-credentials.env>'"
  ```

  After the container restarts, update `${LANE^^}_PG_PASSWORD` in `ops/supabase/lanes/credentials.env` if it changed and re-run the deploy.
